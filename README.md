# docker-practice
I made this repository to practice using Docker. I used two different tutorials on YouTube to make this application. This app is a NodeJS project (using TypeScript) that spins up a PostgresSQL database with a PGAdmin dashboard. This also includes migration scripts to initialize the database.

The tutorials I followed can be found at the following links:

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDBGsS3UVjw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDBGsS3UVjw) - Adding PGAdmin

Credit goes to the creators of the videos above. Most of this source code is their own. I made slight modifications and combined the two to further my understanding of Docker.
